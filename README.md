NexGen Predictive Delivery Optimizer
Overview

This project was developed as part of the NexGen Logistics Innovation Challenge.
The main objective was to analyze delivery performance issues and build a tool that can predict delivery delays before they happen and support better operational decisions.

Problem Statement

NexGen Logistics manages hundreds of monthly orders across multiple warehouses and vehicles.
The company faces challenges with delivery delays, inconsistent customer ratings, and increasing operational costs.
The goal was to use available data to identify what causes these delays and explore how data-driven insights could improve performance.

Approach

I started by exploring all the provided datasets, which included delivery performance, order details, routes, fleet information, cost breakdowns, warehouse inventory, and customer feedback.
After cleaning and merging the data, I noticed that delays were influenced by multiple factors such as the carrier, route, weather impact, and delivery promises.

The next step was to design a dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly for interactive visualization of delivery metrics and performance patterns.
After that, a predictive model was introduced to estimate the likelihood of a delay based on key operational inputs like carrier performance, promised delivery days, and weather impact.

Machine Learning Model

The model was trained on historical delivery data to classify whether an order is likely to be delayed.
Since the dataset was small and based on past outcomes, the model primarily learns from historical patterns.
This limits its logical generalization, but with more data and fine-tuning, accuracy and reliability can significantly improve.

Results

The final tool integrates:

A dashboard that visualizes delivery performance, customer feedback, and operational metrics.

A predictive component that estimates potential delivery delays.

Although not perfect due to limited data, it provides a strong foundation for expanding predictive analytics in logistics planning.

Future Improvements

Collect more historical and real-time delivery data to improve model accuracy.

Introduce mathematical optimization for better route and scheduling suggestions.

Integrate live data (e.g., weather, traffic, carrier status) to make predictions more dynamic.

Use feedback loops to continuously improve the modelâ€™s performance.
